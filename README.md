# Challenge-1

# Horiseon-Refactor

## I was motivated to do this challenging assignment because it's like problem-solving to me, and just like solving a math problem, even though I'm new to this kind of language, it motivates me to find a solution to each problem.
I build this project so I can get a heads-up of what I'm getting into regarding coding and problem-solving with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
It solves the HTML elements platform which is supposed to be visible and accessible  to all readers.
I learned how to use semantic HTML elements to help make sure this coding is more accessible .
